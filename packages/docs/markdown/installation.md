## Installation

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add perfect-dark-mode
```

Then you must somehow add `node_modules/perfect-dark-mode/dist/index.js` as a script in the `<head>` of your page.

How you do this will depend on the framework you are using.

### UNPKG

You can add directly this directly to the `<head>` of your page:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/perfect-dark-mode@0.0.6/dist/index.js"></script>
```
